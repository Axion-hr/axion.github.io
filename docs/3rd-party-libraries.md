# 3rd party library standards

This document outlines mayor version of libraries used for development. Unless there is special reason, all used libraries should have long term support. This will eliminating the need for constant refactoring and fixing bugs because of breaking changes in 3rd party libraries. This does not mean that if some cool new feature is avaialble in the latest version of the library, that given library cannot be used. It only means that *most* of the work is stable and easier to maintain.
