# Spring Boot guidelines

In order to structure the code that we deliver to our partners, and to make our 
lives easier we have agreed on a set of guidelines on coding practices, libraries, 
configurations. This will enable that we collaborate both externally and internally 
between the projects.

All the guidelines are promoted from the proposals, and will be maintained in order
to follow all the best practices.
