# API guidelines

Axion Solutions API standard is based on on Google's https://google.aip.dev/ - "API Improvement Proposals" document. 

AIPs are design documents that summarize Google's API design decisions. They also provide a framework and system for others to document their own API design rules and practices.

Google's APIs guidelines are based on [resource-oriented-design][], which tries to take the best of [RPC][] and [REST][] APIs ideas and standards.
