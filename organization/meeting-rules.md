# Meeting rules

## Intro

The purpose of this document is to provide a guideline on how to organize meetings for best efficiency in our company.

## Before the Meeting

1. Determine whether the meeting is necessary:
   1. Can the topic be solved with a 1-on-1?
   2. Is a written communication preferable?
2. Assign a leader to the meeting and a keeper of the minutes:
   1. Leader: This should - in most cases - be the person with the deepest knowledge of the topic treated.
   2. Keeper of minutes: This should – in most cases – be someone at least familiar with the topics. Meeting minutes are kept on Confluence.
3. Limit attendance to people who can make valuable contributions and decisions. The more people in a meeting, the higher the cost for the attendants and the company.
4. Limit the time. Do not schedule more time than you need. Most meetings are scheduled for a full hour, when they could be scheduled for 20 minutes, 35 minutes or 50 minutes. If you need more time, you can always schedule a follow-up that then can be prepared with the specifics of the encountered problem.
5. Share a calendar invite including all information required to join the meeting:
   1. Agenda and/or questions being discussed, stating responsibilities for individual agenda items (preparation necessary by attendants).
   2. Timebox for each point on the agenda.
   3. Wiki page or attachment to invitation, providing context and overview about the topic being handled. This only makes sense when you send it ahead of time. If you want people to read something ahead of time, give them some time! Sending it 20 minutes before does not make sense.
   4. Clearly stated aim of the meeting:
      1. Take a decision.
      2. Complete an action together.
      3. Inform an audience.
      4. Align on next steps / planning.
   5. Ensure the availability of rooms, materials and/or equipment needed in advance.

## During the Meeting

1. All attendants: Be on time / Leader: Start on time, do not wait for stragglers, it only encourages them.
2. The leader of the meeting assures that the conversation stays on topic (agenda) and time (timeboxes) and that meeting minutes are recorded.
3. Make sure everyone who is speaking is close to the speakerphone (if applicable).
4. Phones & laptops should be switched off, unless that of the person who is taking notes or if an attendee contributes with content. If you feel you cannot contribute to a meeting or follow-up notes are enough for you, ask the meeting leader to leave the meeting.
5. Practice active listening
6. Reserve a minute of time for each item to recap when finishing with a timebox item and reserve enough time at the end in order to wrap all points up altogether. The wrap-up has to leave it clear to all attendants who is going to take care of action items and other responsibilities.

## After the Meeting

1. Send meeting minutes to all participants including wrap-ups of all points discussed, materials, charts and – most importantly – a list of action items with clearly stated responsibilities and agreed priorities and timelines.
2. The leader of the meeting assures that all stakeholders are informed and that all responsible persons receive their action items.
